This website project is to enhance a current website of an organisation that operates in the Education sector. 
We intend to make the website more dynamic and functionally engaging with the user aiding to reduce the scrolling on the main page. 
The current website will be refurbrished with new colour theme that will make it more eye catching to the user. 

We will apply simplicity attributes and UX that is freindly to the user. <br>The organisation should be able to increase the number registration through the WEB. 
At a later stage we will include php components like online payments  and leaner portals but at this current stage we would like to give the current website a complete makeover.
