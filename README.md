# Project: Website Enhancement for Education Organisation

This project aims to upgrade and enhance the existing website of an organisation operating in the Education sector.

The primary objectives are:

Improved User Experience (UX): Introduce a more dynamic and functionally engaging design that minimizes excessive scrolling on the main page.

Modern Look & Feel: Refurbish the site with a refreshed colour theme that is visually appealing and aligns with the organisation’s brand.

Mobile-First Approach: Apply simplicity and responsive design principles to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.

Increased Conversions: Optimise the site’s layout and navigation to support higher user engagement and drive more registrations through the website.

Future Development

In later phases, additional features will be integrated, including:

PHP-based components such as online payments

Learner portals for streamlined interaction with students and staff

At this stage, the focus is on delivering a complete visual and functional makeover of the current website.
